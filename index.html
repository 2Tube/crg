        <h3>The Craigstein Files are a compilation of documents that exposes The horrible/inappropiate content that is spoken, seen, and used by Craig.

        <h3>The Context</h3>
        <p>As known before, Craig has been involved in various incidents of inappropriate behavior and content. This document aims to compile all such instances for public awareness.</p>
        <p>Craig has also been involved in photoshopping inappropriate material,
            Sending inappropiate images/gifs, saying inappropriate things,
            and other inappropriate actions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
        <h3>More into the case</h3>
        <p>The first known incident involving Craig dates back to a few weeks back as in January.
        He was very opposed to the idea of him being gay and sending weird stuff. Although he tried to hide it, the evidence was clear.
        As of writing this I don't want to yap alot so I'll just get to the point.
        Craig is F###ing weird and gay af. and we compiled a bunch of real evidence to prove it.
         these evidence are in form of <a href="images.html">Images</a>&nbsp;<a href="vid.html">Videos</a> and Audios
